     I have a Masters degree in Computer Science with 3+ year experience in software development. I'm interested in building scalable and reliable deep computer vision applications. Previously, I worked with Dr. David Doermann to built analytic components to detect manipulations and inconsistencies in online news media for SemaFor(DARPA).
     
     I am currently working on a project that can detect small object in manipulated images using a diffusion based segmentation method.
